Hi, I am Karthik Srinivasan. I am a PhD student in department of Management Information Systems, Eller College of Management, University of Arizona.
I am new to technical blogging. Github, Markdown and other tools make it all the more exciting to share our experiences in the technical world through personal blogs.

I will use R Markdown and ipython mainly in my blogs.
