		<h2>EDUCATION &amp; CAREER</h2>
		<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at University of Mumbai in 2009. After a two year stint in Accenture-IT services, I got the opportunity to get exposed to the exciting world of Data Sciences through a two year Master of Management Course offered by the Dept. of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Science(IISc).
